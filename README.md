# Startup Revenue Estimator

The dataset I have used contains four independent variables: R&amp;D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. The task is to use this data to train a machine-learning model that can understand how these variables relate to the Profit. With this knowledge, the profit of a new company based on its data can be predicted.

## Objective 

The objective of the Profit Prediction for Startups project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the profit of a startup company based on its spending in various areas and the state in which it operates. This model will provide valuable insights into how different factors such as R&D spending, administration spending, marketing spending, and location influence a startup's profitability. By analyzing these relationships, we aim to create a predictive tool that can assist entrepreneurs and investors in making informed decisions about new ventures.

## Prerequisite 

Before you begin working with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Python 3 is installed on your system.

Required Python libraries and dependencies, which can be installed using pip or conda. 

## Data Description

**R&D Spending**: This represents the amount that startups are spending on research and development activities. It reflects the investment made in innovation and product development.

**Administration Spending**: This variable denotes the amount that startups allocate to administrative functions. It includes expenses related to management and organizational operations.

**Marketing Spending**: This attribute signifies the amount that startups are investing in marketing strategies and promotional activities.

**State**: This categorical variable indicates the state in which a particular startup is located. It captures the geographical aspect of the business.

**Profit**: This is the target variable and represents the amount of profit that a particular startup is making. It serves as the dependent variable that we aim to predict.
